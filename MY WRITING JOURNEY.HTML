  <h1><u><b> MY WRITING JOURNEY</b></u></h1>
  <p ALIGN='JUSTIFY'>Celebrating two years of being a successful published author in the writing industry.
    Following something you love the most alongside your studies is always engrossing and captivating.

    Tallying up my collection of one successful series - Earesha's Fate and the blockbuster launch of Gonec - Ace of spades novella in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Earesha's fate was loved to the extent that a reboot series was announced in December
    2021 titled 'Earesha's Returns'. A stand-alone special episode was launched in 2021 on 2nd October, titled as - The untold story of Earesha on high demands.

    My fuel - comments, reviews and regular redemptions of my books has reached the level that my debut book - Gonec ace of spades, was featured on 20+ websites and top Instagram pages. It was the most loved and trending book on Bookhunt for the year
    2021.

    The launch of the stand-alone supernatural drama fiction novel - The lost town, the fable about life - 100 pages and first-ever in the history of RaghavWritingWorld - the launch of Non-fiction: Trailer - the beginning with traditional publishers
    always remain in talks for one or the other reason.

    With the journey of more than 50+ premium articles with freelancing clients, 20+ poetries, and contribution to teen anthologies for the most adored story - Niharika's Skillophile Exam 2022.

    Working with zillskill as co-creator and content writer at uable has made me adept in this field of creative writing. My books getting featured on uable has got a fantastic response to the level that I was the highest-paid content creator on
    uable for the month of March 2022.

    The adoration and support of my readers have taken to the level that a series was launched separately on uable, seeing their excitement and alacrity. Launched in April 2022, Aranya starrer Mad lawyer is being the most loved episodic fiction on
    uable and currently getting a tremendous response.
    This was my short and crisp two-year journey as a creative and content writer. </p>
